[i:29] Inventory Tweaks is a mod inspired by the Minecraft mod Inventory Tweaks.

[i:109] Features:
 [i:97] When you consume an item, and the same kind of item is in your inventory, it'll automatically go into your hand after use.
 [i:97] A new inventory slot for your Spectre Hood/Helment, right click it to swap them out.
 [i:97] Shift clicking shop slots will automatically buy as much of that item as you can. (Causes minor lag spike occasionally)

Note: Until tML 0.11 finally gets released, this mod will depend on Terraria Hooks.

[i:75] Changelog for 1.9.9.9
 [i:97] Added shift clicking
 [i:97] Fixed extra slot being in the wrong position on different screen resolutions

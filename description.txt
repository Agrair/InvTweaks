[i:29] Inventory Tweaks is a mod inspired by the Minecraft mod Inventory Tweaks. 

[i:109] Features:
 - When you consume an item, and the same kind of item is in your inventory, it'll automatically go into your hand after use.
 - A new inventory slot for your Spectre Hood/Helment, right click it to swap them out.
 - Shift clicking shop slots will automatically buy as much of that item as you can. (WIP)

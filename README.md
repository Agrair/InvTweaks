# Inventory Tweaks
Inventory Tweaks is a Terraria mod that adds some quality of life changes to the way the inventory works. 

Features:
 - When you consume an item, and the same kind of item is in your inventory, it'll automatically go into your hand after use.
 - A new hotbar slot for your Spectre Hood/Helmet, right click it to swap them out.
 - Shift clicking shop slots will open a UI to select how many items to buy the next time you buy.
 - Using Life Fruits, Life Crystals, and Mana Crystals is super fast.
 - Hold down the mouse after chopping a tree to place an acorn if you have one.
 - Buffs are automatically consumed when they run out unless you right click them.
 - A health potion in your inventory will be consumed when you are at 30% HP, configurable.
 - All features are configurable.

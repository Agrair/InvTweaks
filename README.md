# Inventory Tweaks
This is a mod inspired by the Minecraft mod Inventory Tweaks.

Features:
 - When you consume an item, and the same kind of item is in your inventory, it'll automatically go into your hand after use.
 - A new hotbar slot for your Spectre Hood/Helmet, right click it to swap them out.
 - Shift clicking shop slots will automatically buy as much of that item as you can. (Uses tML 0.11 features)
 - Using Life Fruits, Life Crystals, and Mana Crystals is super fast.
 - Cut down a tree and if you have a sapling in your inventory it'll be placed. (Unimplemented)
 - All features are configurable, find the config in your saves folder and open it like a text.

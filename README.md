# InvTweaks
Inventory Tweaks is a mod inspired by the Minecraft mod Inventory Tweaks, for Terraria.

Features:
 - When you consume an item, and the same kind of item is in your inventory, it'll automatically go into your hand after use.
 - A new hotbar slot for your Spectre Hood/Helment, right click it to swap them out.
  - Shift clicking shop slots will automatically buy as much of that item as you can. (Unimplemented)
